# OpenApi Documentation

OpenApi documentation is automatically generated by Flask Hintful.

To access the SwaggerUI the default route is `/swagger`. The default route for the OpenApi JSON specfication is  `/openapi.json`

## Security

You can tell OpenApi which kind of security your application is expecting.

Currently, only these authentication types are supported: Bearer, ApiKey, Basic

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
api = FlaskHintful(app, openapi_security=['bearer', 'apikey', 'basic'])
```

Note: This is just for OpenApi documentation, Flask-Hintful does not handle authentication/authorization.

## Custom Routes

You can change the routes that we are serving the SwaggerUI and OpenApi JSON using these two configurations in your Flask App.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['FLASK_HINTFUL_OPENAPI_JSON_URL'] = '/custom_openapi.json'
app.config['FLASK_HINTFUL_OPENAPI_UI_URL'] = '/custom_swagger'

api = FlaskHintful(app)
```
