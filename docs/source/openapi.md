# OpenApi Documentation

OpenApi documentation is automatically generated by Flask Hintful.

To access the SwaggerUI the default route is `/swagger`. The default route for the OpenApi JSON specfication is  `/openapi.json`


## Custom Routes

You can change the routes that we are serving the SwaggerUI and OpenApi JSON using these two configurations in your Flask App.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['FLASK_HINTFUL_OPENAPI_JSON_URL'] = '/custom_openapi.json'
app.config['FLASK_HINTFUL_OPENAPI_UI_URL'] = '/custom_swagger'

api = FlaskHintful(app)
```
